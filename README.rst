Inventory Control
====================

Overview: 
============
Using the new ways of shopping customers have the opportunity to choose between different suppliers based on the availability of product, c
choices available for tht product and the difference in prices. All this not only provied added benefits to buyers but it also incresed 
the competition among the suppliers. They need to make sure that their inventory system is updated all the tyme informationthey have about their invetory is 
also updated and in addition to this they should have the stock available. Either we talk about online or in store shopping invetory management technique makes a big difference.

Think about when you are shopping in Macys and you can not find your size or color you ask the customer service representative to scan the item and check if they have that item for your size or in different olors.
Representative scans it for us and can tell us right away if item is availabe or not. The scanner is just reading the database for the item availability and different sub catagories for size and color related to taht item.
This is possible because the store is contrling the inventory system using the PERPETUAL INVENTORY system, which not only updates the records in real time and also reduces the risk of theft.
